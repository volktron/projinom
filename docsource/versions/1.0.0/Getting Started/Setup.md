## Setup
To create a new Projinom set of documentation, run the following command:

```bash
./vendor/bin/projinom init <destination>
```

Follow instructions on screen.

## Initial Files
Upon completion of the init command, a directory located at the `<destination>` will
now contain a file structure with markdown files, some configuration `.php` files,
and a copy of the Twig based template for generating the `.html` output.
